# The Sliding Window Discrete Fourier Transform (SWDFT)
This repository implements the Sliding Window Discrete Fourier Transform (SWDFT). We also provide statistical and graphical tools for analyzing SWDFT output. The **r/swdft/** directory hosts the R-package, and the **time-series-paper** uses the R-package to generate simulations and figures for the recently submitted paper: "The Sliding Window Discrete Fourier Transform".
