# The Sliding Window Discrete Fourier Transform (SWDFT)
This repository implements the Sliding Window Discrete Fourier Transform (SWDFT). We also provide several statistical methods based on the SWDFT, and graphical tools to view the output. 

- The *r/swdft* directory contains the *swdft* R-package, also available on CRAN
