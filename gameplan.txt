# --- Goals ---
- Revised "swdft" package for thesis on CRAN by defense

# --- Tasks ---

## R Package
- Submit to CRAN!
  + Get R CMD CHECK passing! (DONE)
  + Get travis.yaml working  
  + Re-write: DESCRIPTION file w/ new version 
  + Update: the README.md file in the base repository to remove the SWDFT for time-series paper 
  + Write: Vignette that displays the basic functionality
- 
- Maybe: Consolidate filter.R to helpers.R (DONE)
- 
- (REACH): Cosine regression: Add a "number of parameters" argument.
- (REACH): Cosine regression: Add an option that automatically selects the largest frequency, use nloptR to find it specifically!
- (REACH) Complex demod + matching demod: Add: Option to pass in a custom range of frequencies. To this AND to complex_demod!
- (REACH) Add a customized Multitaper method.
- (REACH) See if I can write the entire algorithm in c++, then only use a wrapper function for the entire method. This would allow easy integration with Python and other languages as well.

## Python Package
- Read, understand Python Packages and Modules
  + Create leePy for examples of how this works!
- Read, understand "PyTest" Testing Framework
- Read, understand Sphinx Documentation
- Read, understand virtual environments

## **C++ Package**
- Figure out how to put the "swdft" function entirely in C++

## General
- Polish the README and update so that it references the new paper.
